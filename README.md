### Algorithms
Examples of popular and interesting algorithms in my implementation.

1. Each directory represents a solution runnable in IDE via main method
2. Usually each ```Solution.class``` is backed with a ```data.txt``` files to demonstrate work of algorithm 
3. Each algorithm is coupled with ```README.md``` file with description and complexity estimate of algorithm
